(http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/pygame-physics-simulation/creating-pygame-window)
===============
Requires Python 2.7.7 and Pygame 1.9.1

Run the ParticleSimulator.py script to begin the simulation.

Left click and hold a particle to grab, move, or throw it.
Right creates menu at cursor.
Hold spacebar to make the mouse cursor the center of gravity.
'W' 'S' 'E' 'D' keys change the magnitude of gravity.
'R' inverts the gravity from positive to negative
'C' stop the background from blitting each frame.
